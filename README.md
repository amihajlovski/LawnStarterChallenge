These are the steps that need to be done in order to start the app!

npm install -g grunt
bower install
npm install

Just as a notice, requestb.in hasn't allowed CORS so I was testing the app on Chrome with disabled web security flag.
requestb.in url: http://requestb.in/1n4nrul1?inspect

Before starting the app, run "grunt build" from terminal and the run the generated index.html from the build folder.
